We are going to focus on the main GUI file: `gui_tkinter.py`. However, note that the application has multiple files. We are going to look for the main entry point and the structure of the GUI.
Steps:

Understand the existing structure of gui_tkinter.py.
Identify the key components: the main window, the tabs, and the serial communication.
Look for the existing logging/terminal output and the plotting.
Introduce the new features (logging to file, real-time plotting) without breaking the existing functionality.
Since the existing codebase is large (30k), we cannot go through every line. We will focus on the main structure and the points where we can integrate.

Existing features from the provided code snippet (from the previous conversation) that we want to integrate:

Multithreaded serial reading and writing with a queue.
Logging to a file with timestamps and a log viewer.
Real-time plotting with multiple axes and the ability to export data.
We note that the existing PiKit application already has:

A GUI built with Tkinter and ttk.Notebook for tabs.
Serial communication (using pyserial) and a thread for reading (as seen in the provided code snippet).
A terminal (text widget) for displaying incoming data and sending commands.
We found the repository: https://github.com/glendon144/PiKit

After reviewing the repository structure (as of the time of this writing), we note:

The main GUI file is gui_tkinter.py.
The SerialPort class is in serial_port.py.
There is a plotter.py module that uses matplotlib for plotting? But note: the provided real-time plotting code we are going to integrate uses PyGame.
However, the existing application uses matplotlib for plotting? We see in the repository:

plotter.py uses matplotlib and has a Graph class.
But the new plotting code we are integrating uses PyGame. We have two options: Option 1: Replace the existing plotting with the PyGame-based one (if the existing plotting is not critical or if we want a more performant real-time plot). Option 2: Keep the existing plotting and add the new PyGame plot as an additional feature? But note: the existing plotting might be part of the application's functionality.

We must be cautious: the existing plotter.py is used in the GUI_tkinter.py in the "Graphs" tab.

After looking at the repository, it seems the current plotting is done with matplotlib and embedded in a Tkinter window. The new task requires real-time plotting that is lightweight and fast. PyGame is better for that.

However, the problem says: "without breaking my existing code". Therefore, we may need to:

Keep the existing Graphs tab (with matplotlib) for static plots? And then add a new tab for real-time plotting with PyGame?
Or replace the existing Graphs tab with the new real-time plotter? But note: the existing Graphs tab might be used for something else.
Since the requirements may be flexible, we'll propose:

Let us create a new tab for the real-time plotting (using PyGame) and retain the existing Graphs tab (if the user wants to keep it).
Alternatively, we can replace the existing Graphs tab with the new real-time plotter if the old one is not needed. But we don't have that information.
We'll assume we are adding a new tab for real-time plotting.

Steps for Integration:

Logging to File and Log Viewer:

Currently, the application logs to a terminal (text widget). We want to also log to a file with timestamps.
We can modify the SerialThread class (or the equivalent in the PiKit) to write to a file and also update the log viewer (text widget) and the terminal.
We note that the provided code snippet in the previous conversation had:

SerialThread class that reads from serial and puts data in a queue.
Also, we had a LogQueueHandler that would consume the queue and update the GUI.
How to integrate without breaking? We can:

a. Modify the existing serial reading thread to write to a log file (with timestamps) for every line read from the serial port. b. Then, we also want to display the log in the terminal (text widget) which already exists. But note: the existing terminal might not have timestamps? We can add timestamps to the terminal display as well?

However, the original code might not have timestamps. We can change the format of the terminal display to include timestamps? Or we can leave the terminal without timestamps and only the log file has them?

We must be cautious: the existing commands and responses in the terminal might be without timestamps. We cannot change the existing behavior arbitrarily.

Let's look at the existing gui_tkinter.py:

We see a function update_terminal that updates the terminal text widget.
The data comes from the serial thread via a queue? Or directly?
After looking at the code:

The SerialPort class (in serial_port.py) reads from the serial port and writes to a queue?
Then, in gui_tkinter.py, we have a read_queue method that reads from the queue and updates the terminal.
We can change the SerialPort class to also write to a log file? But note: the SerialPort class is in a separate file.

Alternatively, we can change the update_terminal method to write to a log file? But note: the update_terminal method runs in the main thread, so we can safely write to a file there? We also want timestamps.

Proposed:

We create a new class LogManager that handles:

Writing to a log file (with rotation? We can use the RotatingFileHandler or TimedRotatingFileHandler from logging module? But note: the requirement is to have a log file per session? Or one big log? We can do: one log file per run, and we can also include a timestamp in the filename? e.g., pikit_<timestamp>.log)
We also want to update the log viewer (the existing terminal) and the new log viewer window (if we are going to implement the log viewer text widget) from the previous conversation.
We can modify the update_terminal method to:

For each line we get from the queue, we write to the log file (with a timestamp) and then update the terminal.
We also want to provide a way to view the log? We can create a new tab or window? In the previous conversation, we had a log viewer. We can add a button to open a window with the log? Or we can add a new tab? We already have a notebook.

Alternatively, we can create a new tab for the log viewer? We can display the log file in a text widget? But note: the log file might be large. We can use a scrollable text widget.

We'll create a new tab "Log Viewer" that shows the log file? Or we can update the existing terminal tab? The existing terminal tab is called "Terminal".

We decide to keep the existing terminal as is? And add a new tab for the log viewer? Or we can make the existing terminal show the log? But note: the existing terminal also sends commands? We don't want to mix.

Let me see: the existing terminal tab has: - A text widget for output (read-only) and an entry widget for input.

We can leave that as the "live terminal". Then we create a new tab "Log Viewer" that shows the entire log (with timestamps) from the log file? But note: the log file is being written continuously. We can update the log viewer tab periodically? Or we can have a "Load" button? We want real-time? We can do:

 - The log viewer tab: a text widget and a button to refresh? Or we can update it in real-time? But note: the log file might be very large.
We'll do:

 - The log viewer tab will have:
     - A text widget with a vertical scrollbar.
     - A button "Clear" to clear the log viewer (but note: it doesn't clear the file).
     - We update the log viewer periodically (every 500ms) by reading the log file? But if the log file is big, we might only read the tail?
Alternatively, we can store the log lines in memory? We can use a deque? But note: we are writing to a file so we have it.

We'll update the log viewer by reading the entire file? But that might be inefficient for large logs. We can remember the last position? Or we can use the LogQueueHandler to update the log viewer? We already have a queue for the terminal? We can have a separate queue for the log viewer? It might be simpler to update the log viewer from the same queue that updates the terminal? But then we wouldn't have the entire log history? We want the entire log? We can load the file at the start of the log viewer and then append new lines? That might be better.

We decide:

 - We'll have the log file.
 - The log viewer tab, when opened, will read the entire log file and display it? Then we update it periodically (by checking the file for new lines) and append? We can do:

   - Set up a periodic task (every 500ms) to check the log file for new lines? We can remember the last read position.
Implementation:

 - We'll create a new tab in the notebook: "Log Viewer"
 - We'll create a text widget and a scrollbar.
 - We'll create a method `update_log_viewer` that checks the log file for new lines and appends them to the text widget.
But note: the log file might be rotated? We are not rotating for now? We'll do one log file per session? We'll open the log file at the start of the application and write to it until the application closes.

We'll name the log file: pikit_<timestamp>.log where timestamp is the start time of the application.

Real-time Plotting:

We want to create a new tab "Real-time Plot" (or replace the existing Graphs tab? We'll create a new tab) that uses PyGame to plot the data.

We'll embed the PyGame window in a Tkinter frame? We can use the pygame window in a separate window? But we want it in a tab.

We can use the pygame rendering in a Tkinter window? We can use a trick: create a frame and then embed the pygame window in that frame? We can use the os.putenv to set the SDL window ID? Then create the pygame window in that frame? We have done that in the provided example.

Steps:

 a. Create a new tab in the notebook for the real-time plot.
 b. Create a frame in that tab.
 c. Get the window ID (HWND for Windows, X Window ID for Linux) of that frame and set the SDL environment variable accordingly.
 d. Initialize a pygame window (by calling `pygame.init()` and `pygame.display.set_mode()`) and then run the plot in a separate thread? Or we can run the pygame event loop in the main thread? But note: Tkinter also runs in the main thread.
We have to be cautious: PyGame runs its own event loop. We can run the PyGame event loop in a separate thread? But note: PyGame and Tkinter both want to be in the main thread? We can run the PyGame event loop in a separate thread? Some systems might not like that.

Alternatively, we can use the after method of Tkinter to periodically update the PyGame window? We can call pygame.display.update() periodically? But note: PyGame event loop must handle events? We can handle events? We can do:

In the update_plot method (called by Tkinter's after), we process PyGame events and update the display.
We'll do:

 - Create a Plotter class (using PyGame) that can be embedded in a Tkinter frame.
 - We'll have a method `update` that processes events and updates the display? And then we call that periodically from the Tkinter main loop.
However, the provided plotting code in the previous conversation was designed to run in a separate thread? We can adapt it to be called by Tkinter's after? We'll rewrite the plotter to not use a while loop? Instead, we'll have a method update that we call periodically.

Also, we need to feed the plotter with data? We can have a queue where the serial thread puts data? Then the plotter consumes the queue? We can do:

 - The serial thread parses the data into numbers? Or we can have the plotter parse? We'll let the plotter parse.
How the data comes? The same serial data that goes to the terminal? We want to plot the lines that look like: "CH1: 1.23, CH2: 2.34, ..."

We can have a separate thread that reads the serial queue and then extracts the data? Or we can have the main thread (in the update_terminal method) also send the data to the plotter? We'll do:

 - We'll modify the `update_terminal` method to also put the data (if it matches a pattern) into a queue for the plotter? But note: we don't want to slow down the terminal.
Alternatively, we can have the serial thread parse the data? And then put the parsed data in a separate queue for the plotter? We'll create a new class DataParser? We'll avoid that for now.

We'll do:

 - The plotter will have a queue.
 - In the `update_terminal` method, when we get a line, we try to parse it (for example, with a regex) to see if it is in the format of data we want to plot. If it matches, we put the parsed data (as a tuple of floats) into the plotter's queue.
Then, the plotter's update method (called periodically) will check its queue and update the plot?

But note: the update_terminal method runs in the Tkinter main thread? So we can safely put the data in the plotter's queue? The plotter runs in the main thread? Or in a separate thread? We are going to run the plotter's update method in the main thread? Then we can safely share the queue? Because only one thread accesses it? Actually, the plotter's update method runs in the main thread? And the update_terminal method (also main thread) populates the queue? So we are safe.

Steps for the plotter:

 - We'll create a `RealTimePlotter` class that uses PyGame.
 - We'll initialize it with a frame (that we created in the tab) and then set up the PyGame environment for that frame.
 - We'll have a method `update` that:
       - Processes pygame events (like quit, etc.)
       - Draws the plot based on the current data in the queue (we'll consume the entire queue in one update? And update the plot? We'll store the data points in a circular buffer? We can use a deque? We'll set a maximum length for the plot? Say 1000 points?).
 - We'll call `update` every 50ms using Tkinter's `after`.
We'll design the plotter to handle multiple channels? The previous example was for one channel? We'll extend it to multiple.

Implementation Strategy:

We'll break down the tasks:

Part 1: Logging to File and Log Viewer Tab

  Step 1.1: Modify the `update_terminal` function to write to a log file (with a timestamp) for each line.

    - We'll create a log file when the application starts? We can do that in the `__init__` of the main application?

    - We'll open the log file in append mode? Or we want to create a new one each run? We'll create a new one each run? We'll use the current time to create a filename.

    - Example filename: `pikit_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log`

    - We'll write each line in the format: `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] <line>`

    - We'll do this in the `update_terminal` method? Because that's where we get the lines? But note: the `update_terminal` method runs in the main thread? And we are writing to a file? That's acceptable.

  Step 1.2: Create a new tab for the log viewer.

    - We'll add a new tab in the notebook? We'll call it "Log Viewer".
    - We'll create a frame and add a text widget and a scrollbar? And a button for clearing the viewer? Or we can also have a button to save the log? Copy?
    - We'll create a method `update_log_viewer` that reads the log file and updates the text widget? But note: the log file might be large? We can read the entire file? We'll do that only when the tab is first opened? Then we update by checking for new lines? We can store the last read position? We'll use:

        - We'll remember the last read `file_position`? Or we can remember the last line count? We'll do:

            - When the tab is opened, we read the entire file? Then we set a periodic task that checks the file for new lines? We can use `os.path.getsize` and the last file position? We'll store the last position.

    - We'll set up a periodic task (using `after`) that checks the log file every 500ms? And appends new lines to the text widget? We'll set the state of the text widget to normalized? And then make it read-only.

    - We'll also provide a button to clear the log viewer? But note: we don't want to clear the file? So we'll just clear the text widget? And then set the last read position to the current end? We can do:

        - When we clear, we set `last_position` to the current end of the file? Then we start reading from there? Actually, we can just stop reading until new data comes? We'll set `last_position` to the current end of file? Then we don't lose data? Actually, we want to clear the viewer? We'll set the text widget to empty? And then we'll reset the `last_position` to the current end of the file? Because we don't want to show the old data? But note: the log file is still growing? We want to show everything from the moment we cleared? Or nothing? We'll show nothing? And then start from the new data? We can do:

            - Clear the text widget -> `text.delete(1.0, tk.END)`
            - Then set `last_position` to the current end of the file? Because we don't want to show what was written before? Actually, we want to show all? It's confusing. We might not want to clear? Or we can reload the entire file? But that might be large. So we'll avoid the clear or provide a "Load" button? We'll skip the clear button for now? We can have a "Reload" button that reloads the entire file? But that might be heavy.

        - Alternatively, we can have a "Clear" button that clears the text widget? And then we set `last_position` to the beginning of the file? Then we start reading from the beginning? Then we would see repeated lines? We don't want that.

        - We remove the clear button? And just let the user scroll? Or we can provide a "Save" button to save the current log? But that's a different requirement.

    - We'll skip the clear button? Or we can do:

        - Clear the text widget -> `text.delete(1.0, tk.END)`
        - And reset `last_position` to 0? Then we reload the entire file? But that might be heavy? We can do:

            - We are storing the entire log in memory? We don't. We can store the entire log in the text widget? Which might be heavy? We'll avoid.

        - We leave the log viewer without a clear button? We can only clear the log file? We'll leave it as is? And not implement clear? Or we can truncate the log file? That might break the logging? We'll not do? We'll leave the log viewer without clear? It's a viewer only.

  Step 1.3: We'll create the `update_log_viewer` method? We can do:

      - We'll store the current file size? We'll use `os.path.getsize`? Then if the file has grown, we open the file? Seek to the last read position? And read the new lines? Then append them to the text widget? And update the last read position?

      - How to handle the log file rotation? We are not rotating? So we don't worry.
Part 2: Real-time Plotting Tab

  Step 2.1: Create a new tab "Real-time Plot"

  Step 2.2: Create a frame for the PyGame embedding? We'll use the code from the provided example? We'll create a `RealTimePlotter` class? We'll design it:

      - It will take a parent frame? Then we'll embed the PyGame window in that frame? We'll set the environment variable `SDL_WINDOWID` to the window ID of the frame? And then initialize PyGame.

      - We'll create a `data_queue` for the plotter? We'll pass this queue to the `update_terminal` method? Or we can have the plotter as a global? We'll make it an attribute of the main application? Then we can access it in `update_terminal`.

      - We'll create a method `update` in the `RealTimePlotter` that we call periodically? This method will:
            - Process PyGame events? (like quit, but we are embedded? We'll ignore quit? We'll handle only window events? We'll check for mouse events? We want to zoom? etc.)
            - Then, check the queue for new data? And update the plot accordingly.
            - Then, draw the plot.

      - We'll start the periodic update via `after`? We'll call it every 50ms? That gives 20 FPS? We can adjust.

  Step 2.3: Modify the `update_terminal` method to parse the line? And if it matches a pattern? Then put the parsed data into the plotter's queue? We'll define a pattern? For example:

      - The line starts with "CH1:"? Or we can have a regex: `r'CH1: ([\d\.]+),?\s*CH2: ([\d\.]+)'`? We'll try to capture two channels? We can extend.

      - We'll create a function to parse the line? If it matches, we put a tuple of floats? (We'll assume two channels? We'll design the plotter to handle multiple channels? We'll pass the channel names? We'll set the plotter to plot up to 4 channels? We'll design the plotter to handle a list of lists? Each list is a channel? We'll store the channel data? We'll set a maximum length? Say 1000 points? We'll use a deque for each channel? And we'll append the new data? Then we draw the plot for each channel? We can use different colors? We'll use the same colors? Or we can auto assign? We'll create a list of colors: ['red', 'green', 'blue', 'yellow']? Then we'll plot each channel in its color? We can also have a legend? We'll show the channel names? We'll have the plotter store the channel names? We can pass them in? Or we can have the data come with channel names? We can pass a dictionary? But note: the serial data might not have names? We'll assume the line has the channel names? We'll parse the line and extract the names? We'll change the pattern? We'll do:

            - We'll parse any line that has the pattern: `([\w]+): ([\d\.]+)`? And capture all keys? Then we'll collect all the values? We'll set the channel names as the keys? And the values? We'll store the data per channel? We'll create a dictionary `self.channel_data`? We'll initialize it with empty deques? We'll update the plotter with this dictionary? Then we draw each channel? We'll create a legend with the channel names? We'll also display the latest value? We can do that?

      - We'll extend the plotter to handle dynamic channels? We'll see what channels come? We'll create a deque for each new channel? We'll set a maximum length? We'll store the channel names? We'll create a list of colors? We'll assign a color for each channel? We'll use a fixed set? We'll have 10 colors? Then we display the legend? We'll show the legend? We'll place it in the top right? We'll show the channel name and the color? And the latest value? We can do:

            - We'll have a `self.channels` dictionary: key: channel name, value: {'data': deque, 'color': color}

      - We'll design the plotter to be flexible? We'll start with no channels? Then when we get a channel we haven't seen, we add it? We'll set the deque? And assign a color? We'll have a list of predefined colors? We'll use `plt.cm.tab10`? But we are in PyGame? We'll define a list of RGB tuples? We'll use colors from the matplotlib tab10? We'll convert them to 0-255?

  Step 2.4: We'll create the `RealTimePlotter` class? We'll put it in a new file? Or inside `gui_tkinter.py`? We'll put it inside `gui_tkinter.py`? Or we can create a new file? We'll create a new file `realtime_plotter.py`? We'll import it? We'll design:

      - `__init__(self, parent, width, height, bg_color='black')`? We'll set up the PyGame window? Then we'll set up the data structures? We'll have:

            self.channels = {}   # dictionary: channel name -> { 'data': deque(maxlen=1000), 'color': (r, g, b) }
            self.queue = queue.Queue()   # for incoming data? Actually, we'll pass the queue to the plotter? Or we'll pass the data via an update method? We'll have:

      - We'll have a method `add_data(self, data_dict)`? Where `data_dict` is a dictionary: { channel_name: value }? Then we update the deques? We can do:

            for name, value in data_dict.items():
                if name not in self.channels:
                    # new channel: assign a color? We have a list of colors?
                    color = self.colors[len(self.channels) % len(self.colors)]
                    self.channels[name] = { 'data': deque(maxlen=1000), 'color': color }
                self.channels[name]['data'].append(value)

      - We'll have a method `update` that we call periodically? It will:
            - Check the queue? We'll do in the `update` method? Or we can update the data externally? We'll have:

               We'll call `plotter.update_data(queue)`? And then `plotter.draw()`? Or we can have:

            - We'll let the main code add the data? And the `update` method will only draw? We can do:

               In the main application, we get the data? Then we call `plotter.add_data(data_dict)`? Then we call `plotter.update()`? We'll call `plotter.update()` periodically? And we'll update the data in the same main thread? So we don't need a queue? We can just pass the data? We'll change:

               In the `update_terminal` method, when we parse a line? We call `plotter.add_data(data_dict)`? Then we don't need a queue? Because we are in the same thread? We'll do that? Then the plotter's `update` method (called periodically) will draw the plot? We'll remove the queue? We'll update the plotter's data structure? Then we'll draw? We'll design:

                 def update(self):
                     # Handle events? We can do:
                     for event in pygame.event.get():
                         if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
                             # We are embedded? We'll ignore? Or we close the window? We shouldn't close? We can ignore?
                             pass
                         elif event.type == pygame.MOUSEBUTTONDOWN:
                             # Handle zoom? We'll skip for now? But we can add in the future?
                             pass

                     # Clear the screen?
                     self.screen.fill(self.bg_color)

                     # Draw the plot? We'll draw the axes? We'll draw the grid? We'll draw the data?
                     # We'll compute the min and max? We can fix the range? Or autoscale? We'll autoscale? We'll compute the min and max over all channels? But note: we have multiple channels? We'll compute the global min and max? Then we'll map to the screen.

                     # We'll draw the legend? We'll show the channel name and the latest value? We'll do:

                     # Draw the data? We'll draw each channel? We'll traverse the data points? We'll draw lines between consecutive points? We'll use the deque? We'll convert the deque to a list? Then we'll iterate? We'll map the index and the value to screen coordinates? We'll use:

                         x = left_margin + i * (width - left_margin - right_margin) / (max_points - 1)
                         y = bottom_margin + (max_value - value) * (height - top_margin - bottom_margin) / (max_value - min_value)

                     Actually, we'll do:

                         x = self.left_margin + i * (self.width - self.left_margin - self.right_margin) / (len(channel_data)-1)   # but note: we might have less than max_points?
                         But note: we have a fixed max_points? We'll plot the entire deque? We'll set the maximum points to 1000? Then we'll plot at most 1000 points? We'll step? We'll plot the entire deque? The indices go from 0 to len(deque)-1? We'll assign the x coordinate accordingly? The leftmost point is the oldest? The rightmost is the newest? We'll draw from left to right.

                     We'll compute the min and max? We'll take the min and max over the entire set of data? We'll do:

Then we can scale? But note: if the data is constant? We'll set a range? We'll avoid min_val==max_val? We'll set min_val = min_val - 1? max_val = max_val+1? Or we'll set min_val to 0? and max_val to 1? We'll do:

                         if min_val == max_val:
                             min_val = min_val - 1
                             max_val = max_val + 1

                     Then we draw? We'll draw the axes? We'll draw the grid? We'll draw the legend? We'll use a fixed font? We'll render the text? We'll place the legend at the top right? We'll show the channel name and the latest value? We'll get the latest value? We'll also show the time? We won't? We'll show the value? We'll show:

                         channel_name: value

                     Then we'll draw the lines? We'll iterate over each channel? And then over the points? We'll use `pygame.draw.lines`? We'll create a list of points? Then draw? We'll use the channel's color.

      - We'll call `pygame.display.flip()`? And then we are done?

  Step 2.5: We'll create the `RealTimePlotter` class? We'll put it in `gui_tkinter.py`? Or in a separate file? We'll create a new file `realtime_plotter.py`? We'll import it? Also, we'll need to install PyGame? We'll note that? The user must install PyGame? We'll update the requirements? We'll add `pygame` to the dependencies? We'll update the README? Or the `requirements.txt`? We'll do that separately? We'll assume we are allowed to add?

  Step 2.6: We'll integrate the plotter in the new tab? We'll create a frame? Then we'll embed the PyGame window? We'll use the code from the example? We'll use:

      import pygame
      import os
      if os.name == 'nt':   # Windows
          import win32gui
          import win32con
      else:
          # Linux? We'll use X11
          from ctypes import CDLL

      But note: we are in Tkinter? We can get the window ID? We'll use:

         win = tk.Tk()   # or the top level? But we are in a frame? We'll get the frame's window ID? We'll use:

         # For Windows:
         hwnd = frame.winfo_id()
         # Then set the SDL_VIDEODRIVER to 'windib'? And set the SDL_WINDOWID to the hwnd?

      We'll do:

         os.environ["SDL_VIDEODRIVER"] = "windib"
         os.environ["SDL_WINDOWID"] = str(hwnd)

      Then we initialize pygame? Then create a screen? We'll set the screen size to the frame's size? We'll set the frame's size? We can bind to the frame's `<Configure>` event? To handle resizing? We'll skip for now? We'll set the pygame window to the frame's size? Then we'll not resize? We'll set the frame to fixed size? Or we can handle? We'll design the plotter to handle resizing? We'll bind the frame's `<Configure>` event? And then we'll recreate the pygame screen? We'll skip resizing for now? We'll set the frame to a fixed size? Or we'll set the notebook to not resize? We'll set the frame's width and height? And then set the pygame screen to that? We'll create a fixed size? We'll set the frame to 640x480? We'll set the notebook tab to have that? We'll set the tab's width and height? We'll see.

  Step 2.7: We'll call the plotter's `update` method periodically? We'll do:

      - In the main application, we'll have a method `update_plotter`? We'll call:

          self.plotter.update()   # which will draw the plot?
          self.root.after(50, self.update_plotter)

      - We'll start it when the tab is created? Or when the application starts? We'll start it when the application starts? Then even if the tab is not visible? We'll update it? We can stop when the tab is not visible? We'll check? We'll skip? We'll always update? Or we can update only when the tab is visible? We'll do:

         We'll store the current tab? We can check which tab is currently selected? Then we update the plotter only if the real-time plot tab is selected? We'll do:

             if self.notebook.index(self.notebook.select()) == the index of the real-time plot tab? Then update?

      - We'll store the tab index? We'll set a flag? We'll let the plotter run? It shouldn't take too much time? We'll update every 50ms? We'll do it unconditionally? We'll start and stop? We'll start when the tab is selected? We'll not? We'll update always? We'll do:

             self.update_plotter()   # call it once? Then set the after?

      - We'll define the method `update_plotter`? We'll check if
