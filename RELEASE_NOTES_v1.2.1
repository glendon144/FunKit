🌐 URL → OPML (v1.2.1)

Turn any web page into a clean, navigable OPML outline — in one click.
No clutter. No ads. Just the structure.

Why this is exciting

⚡ Fast signal extraction: Skip the noise and scan a page as an outline.

🧭 Instant navigation: Expand/collapse headings with carets right in PiKit.

🧰 Portable: OPML plays nicely with other outline tools.

How to use it

Option A — Toolbar

Click URL → OPML.

Paste one or more URLs (newline-separated).

Press OK. The first outline opens automatically; others appear in the index.

Option B — Menu

File → Import URL → OPML (same dialog as above)

Batch import: paste multiple URLs at once — each becomes its own OPML document.

Modes & control

Tools → Network/URL → URL Import Mode

Quick (default): ~12s total / ~600 KB per URL

Full: ~25s total / ~2.5 MB per URL

🛑 Cancelable: A small “Fetching URLs…” dialog lets you Cancel mid-import.

🧵 Responsive: Fetch runs in the background; the UI stays snappy.

💾 Safe writes: All database updates happen on the main thread (no SQLite thread errors).

What gets saved

✅ New OPML documents titled like: Example Page Title (OPML)

🔒 Original HTML is not stored (we harvest structure, not the entire page)

Rendering & navigation

🪄 OPML opens in the main pane with caret expand/collapse.

⬅️ Back returns to your previous document.

🔍 Use the Tree view anytime for a dedicated outline window.

Smart fallbacks

Some sites are heavy or defensive (big publisher CDNs, paywalls, etc.). We handle that:

🧠 HTML → OPML (primary path)

✨ Text fallback when HTML is tricky — still produces a useful outline

🧪 Validation: OPML is parsed in-memory before saving; leading noise is trimmed

🛠️ Repair tools:

Tools → Repair current doc → OPML (overwrite)

Batch: Repair selected OPML docs (toolbar)

Tips for great outlines

Prefer article / reader URLs when possible (less nav/UI chrome).

Multi-URL imports are supported — each URL on its own line.

For very stubborn sites, try Quick mode first; if needed, switch to Full.

Troubleshooting

Spinner lasts too long
• Use Quick mode, then try Cancel if the site slow-walks content.
• Try Full mode for larger articles.

“Unsupported Content-Type”
• The URL isn’t HTML/XML (e.g., PDF, image). Convert text separately or use other import options.

Outline looks too minimal
• That’s the text fallback. Try Full mode, or use the Repair tool on the document.

Optional dependencies (improves fetching)
Always show details
pip3 install requests chardet


requests → better TLS/redirects & streaming

chardet → smarter encoding detection

Why OPML (again)?

OPML is a timeless, lightweight way to think in outlines — a perfect bridge between Doug Engelbart’s vision and today’s web. By harvesting structure from pages, PiKit helps you tame the noisy web into something you can scan, reorganize, and reason about.

Quick start

Install & launch PiKit

Click URL → OPML on the toolbar

Paste a URL (or many), hit OK

Expand the carets and get the gist in seconds ✨
