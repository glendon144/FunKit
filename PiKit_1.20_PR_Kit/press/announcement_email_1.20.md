Subject: PiKit 1.20 — Universal Reader is live

PiKit 1.20 turns your exports into a personal, shareable intraweb.

Highlights:
• Reader/Code toggle per doc (auto detects HTML)  
• Clean, green links + share links  
• Index view modes (auto/list/gallery), optional thumbnails  
• Base64 image support + /asset decoding; friendly 404/500 + /health  

Try it:
- Update to the latest code.
- Launch Flask from the GUI (auto-picks a free port).
- Open a doc and switch between Code and Reader.

Why it matters:
OPML fidelity made HTML rendering easy — PiKit now doubles as a reader-mode web archiver.
