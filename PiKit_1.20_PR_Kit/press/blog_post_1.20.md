# PiKit 1.20 — A Universal Reader, Hiding in Plain Sight

We set out to faithfully render OPML. Somewhere along the way we realized: with OPML’s outline structure intact, HTML was already within reach. PiKit 1.20 takes that realization to its logical conclusion — a dual-mode document viewer where **Reader** renders HTML like a clean newspaper article, and **Code** preserves indentation for poetry, JSON, and source files.

It’s a different kind of web experience: import a page, view it ad-free, keep it forever, and share a simple link with colleagues. That’s not a browser — that’s an augmentation tool in the spirit of **Douglas Engelbart**.

**What’s inside**  
- Reader/Code toggle per document (auto detection).  
- Green links, share links, and lightweight UI.  
- Index views (auto / list / gallery) with optional placeholders.  
- Image handling via Base64 and `/asset` routes.  

PiKit 1.20 is the first milepost in a longer road toward a truly personal, linked knowledge web.
