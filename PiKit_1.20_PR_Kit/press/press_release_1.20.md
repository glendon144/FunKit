# Press Release — PiKit 1.20

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE** — 2025-08-24

**PiKit 1.20 launches the “Universal Reader”** — a lightweight intraweb that renders OPML and HTML with clean Reader Mode styling, preserves structured text as preformatted code when needed, and lets users share documents via simple HTTP links.

“By honoring the structure of OPML, we found ourselves just a step away from HTML,” said the PiKit team. “Engelbart’s ideas about links and outliners still pay dividends — this release turns personal knowledge into a navigable, shareable web.”

**What’s new**
- Reader/Code toggle per document (auto-detects HTML).
- Green-link interface, share links, and compact index with optional thumbnails.
- Base64 images and asset decoding.
- `/health` endpoint and friendly error pages.

**About PiKit**
PiKit is an augmentation tool inspired by **Douglas Engelbart** — a place where notes, code, and web pages become linked, durable knowledge.
