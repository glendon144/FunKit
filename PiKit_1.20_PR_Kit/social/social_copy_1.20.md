## X / Twitter
PiKit 1.20 is out 🎉
It’s a UNIVERSAL READER:
• Reader/Code toggle per doc
• Clean, green links + share links
• Index views (auto/list/gallery)
• Base64 images + /asset decoding
OPML fidelity made HTML rendering easy — ad‑free “reader mode” is now built in.

We just shipped PiKit 1.20. By honoring OPML’s structure, HTML “reader mode” emerged almost for free. Documents now toggle between Reader (HTML) and Code (preformatted) views, with share links and a clean index. A small step that feels like a leap toward Engelbart’s vision.
