# FunKit as a Universal Reader
### From OPML Fidelity to HTML Rendering

When Doug Engelbart gave *The Mother of All Demos* in 1968, he showed that documents could be linked, structured, and viewed in multiple ways. FunKit follows that lineage.

By pursuing **faithful OPML rendering**, we discovered that HTML rendering was already within reach. OPML’s hierarchical XML mirrors the structure of the HTML DOM. Once FunKit preserved OPML structure and escaping, the **Reader Mode** effect arose naturally: import web pages as OPML → FunKit renders clean, ad‑free articles you can read offline and share via simple HTTP links.

FunKit 1.20 packages this into:
- **Reader/Code toggle** per document.
- **Shareable intraweb** with clean green‑link styling.
- **Index views** and image support for quick browsing.

FunKit is not a browser — it’s a **knowledge instrument** that reduces notes, code, articles, and archives to a single, coherent representation you control.
