Great plan. Below is a tightened, decision-oriented expansion with concrete defaults, acceptance criteria, and low-risk implementation details. If you confirm your lineage (Engelbart deep hypertext vs. P2P browser), I can tailor importers, link syntax, and the MVP demo script precisely.

Recommended defaults to reduce decision thrash
- Differentiator: Engelbart-style granular links and transclusions for local knowledge bases that remain stable across edits.
- MVP workflows:
  1) Create and share deep links into Markdown/HTML (paragraph/line/range anchors) that remain stable after edits.
  2) View multiple synchronized lenses of the same document (outline + full text + backlinks) and perform transclusions.
- Tech stack: Rust core + Tauri GUI + shared CLI/TUI (Ratatui). Plugins via JSON-RPC over stdio (language-agnostic, easy to version). Static-site exporter for shareable, read-only deep links on the web.

1) Clarify value and scope
- Crisp promise: “Stable, granular links and transclusions for your documents—links that don’t break when text moves.”
- What uniquely good looks like:
  - Deterministic, stable IDs at block/paragraph/sentence level.
  - Range addressing with robust re-anchoring after edits (fuzzy matching).
  - Multi-view lenses: outline, backlinks, and “transclusion pane.”
- Acceptance criteria:
  - Paste a deep link from Hyperscope into Slack/Docs; recipients can open the exact span later even after edits.
  - Import a folder of Markdown and instantly navigate via generated outline/backlinks.
  - Transclude a section of Doc A into Doc B and see live updates when A changes.
- 3-minute demo script:
  1) Open sample corpus; click “Deep Links 101.md.”
  2) Copy link to paragraph 3; paste in a second window; navigate; highlight shows.
  3) Edit document (move paragraphs); reopen the link; highlight snaps to the same logical paragraph.
  4) Open split view: outline on left, text on right; click outline node; selection syncs.
  5) Create a new note and transclude “Design/Addressing.md §Stability”; show it stays in sync.

2) Technical strategy for a small, fast binary
- Core language: Rust (memory safety, great parsers, small static binaries).
- Architecture:
  - hyperscope-core (no GUI):
    - parsers: Markdown (pulldown-cmark), HTML5 (html5ever), OPML (quick-xml), JSON.
    - segmenter/ID assigner: stable block IDs + sentence IDs; content-defined boundaries (rolling hash) plus heuristics to survive edits.
    - re-anchoring: fuzzy locator using context windows + ID hint; diff-match-patch fallback.
    - storage/index: SQLite (rusqlite) or sled for speed; initial index stored in .hs/index.db per workspace.
    - addressing: hs:// scheme + fragment syntax; also file:// fallback with #g= anchor.
    - export: HTML with embedded anchors and a tiny JS highlighter for ranges.
  - hs-cli: import, index, link-create, link-resolve, export.
  - hs-tui: Ratatui-based viewer (outline + text + backlinks).
  - hs-gui: Tauri shell wrapping the core with native menus, system handlers for hs: links.
- Plugin system:
  - Transport: JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio subprocess (like Language Server Protocol).
  - Capabilities: content importers, renderers, link resolvers, commands.
  - Versioning: semantic versioned Core API v1 (JSON schemas), feature flags.
  - Security: capability manifest; plugins run with restricted FS access; no network unless granted.
- WebAssembly companion:
  - Build hyperscope-core-wasm for in-browser demo (read-only viewer + deep-links), but focus dev on the binary.
- Performance budgets:
  - Binary ≤ 50 MB macOS, ≤ 40 MB Linux; cold start ≤ 500 ms.
  - Index 10k-line Markdown repo in ≤ 10 s; steady-state navigation latency ≤ 30 ms.

3) Packaging and distribution that feel mainstream
- Build matrix: macOS x64/arm64, Windows x64/arm64, Linux x64/arm64.
- Tools:
  - cargo-dist for cross-OS releases and artifacts.
  - Tauri bundler for DMG/MSI/AppImage; Flatpak manifest via flatpak-builder.
  - Homebrew formula (tap), Scoop manifest, winget package, apt repo later if demand.
- Code signing/notarization:
  - macOS: Developer ID cert + notarytool; hardened runtime.
  - Windows: EV Code Signing cert + signtool + SmartScreen reputation build-up.
  - Linux: detached signatures + SBOM; no root installers by default.
- Auto-updates:
  - Tauri’s autoUpdater with your signed channel for macOS/Windows.
  - Linux: opt-in via AppImage update or Flatpak; respect distro policies.
- Reproducibility:
  - Deterministic builds with cargo dist; supply SHA256 and minisign/sigstore signatures.
  - SBOM via cargo auditable and/or Syft; publish with releases.

4) Compatibility and data pathways
- Import:
  - Legacy Hyperscope/Augment: implement a dedicated importer and link translator early; publish mapping rules.
  - Markdown/HTML/OPML/JSON: initial set. For Markdown, support CommonMark + frontmatter metadata.
- Export:
  - HTML static site: preserves anchors, adds highlighting script for ranges, and “open in Hyperscope” buttons.
  - Markdown with embedded stable IDs as HTML comments for round-tripping.
- Addressing scheme:
  - hs://workspace/doc?view=reader#b=g:PARA-GUID,s=offset..offset
  - Back-compat: recognize legacy link syntax; translate to new scheme and store a redirect table.
- Migration tool:
  - hs-cli migrate --input <path> --legacy-type augment|hyperscope-old --dry-run
  - Generates a report of translated links and mismatches.

5) Product polish that reduces friction
- First-run:
  - Sample corpus: three short docs—Deep Links 101, Transclusion Showcase, Multi-View Tour.
  - 60-second guided tour modal; “copy deep link” CTA appears contextually.
- Defaults:
  - Keyboard-first: vim-like and macOS-friendly shortcuts; quick-open (Cmd/Ctrl-P); command palette (Cmd/Ctrl-Shift-P).
- Crash reporting/telemetry:
  - Sentry or Glitchtip for crashes; opt-in toggle during onboarding; public schema and retention policy.
- Performance monitoring:
  - Built-in metrics panel (hidden) to show cold start, index time; for dev support.

6) Security and privacy
- No background daemons. Tauri sandbox; file access only after user selection (scoped directories).
- Offline by default; network only for updates if opted in.
- Supply SBOMs; CI runs cargo audit and osv-scanner; weekly dependency updates PRs.
- Signed releases on all platforms.

7) Engineering operations
- CI/CD (GitHub Actions):
  - Lint (clippy), fmt, unit/integration tests, wasm build check, fuzz corpus smoke test.
  - Cross-compile, sign, notarize, upload artifacts on tag.
- Testing:
  - Golden tests for importers and anchor generation.
  - Fuzz parsers and re-anchoring (cargo-fuzz); seed with real docs.
  - Cross-platform UI smoke tests (Playwright with Tauri driver).
- Process:
  - Issue templates (bug, feature), discussion for proposals.
  - Tiny RFCs for core API changes (one-pager: problem, design, migration).
  - Release cadence: monthly minor; patch as needed; changelog with “migration notes.”

8) Documentation and learning
- Docs stack: Docusaurus or mdBook; host on GitHub Pages.
- Quickstart: install, import folder, copy a deep link, share, export to web.
- 10 task recipes:
  - Make a paragraph link; link a text range; transclude; compare two versions; build backlinks; export static site; install plugin; write a plugin; VS Code command; intercept hs: links in browser.
- “Deep Links 101” tutorial:
  - Concepts: stable IDs, ranges, re-anchoring, link rot prevention.
  - How it maps to Markdown/HTML.
- API docs:
  - JSON-RPC schemas with examples; example plugin repo (TypeScript and Rust); starter template.

9) Community and governance
- Keep core tiny; encourage plugins for importers/renderers/integrations.
- Governance:
  - Maintainers group; CODEOWNERS; weekly triage; public roadmap; “Good first issues.”
  - DCO or CLA? Prefer DCO + CoC (e.g., Contributor Covenant).
- Community:
  - Monthly office hours on Zoom/Jitsi; recordings on YouTube; notes in repo.
  - Plugin registry via a curated README and later a simple directory JSON.

10) Awareness and adoption
- Story: “Bring deep, stable links and transclusions to your knowledge base.”
- Landing page:
  - One-liner, three GIFs (deep link surviving edits, transclusion, multi-view), download buttons.
- Launch playbook:
  - Pre-brief a few friendly reviewers; publish to HN/Reddit/Dev.to; 3–5 minute demo video; short thread on X/BlueSky; crosspost to knowledge management communities.
- Seed integrations:
  - VS Code extension: “Copy deep link,” “Open hs: link,” inline decorations for anchors.
  - Obsidian plugin: context menu for deep link; transclusion block.
  - Browser extension: register hs: protocol handler; fallback resolver to local app via custom URL scheme.
- Network effects:
  - “Export to web” with shareable links that open in browser and suggest “Open in Hyperscope” if installed.

11) Funding and sustainability
- License:
  - Core: MPL-2.0 (business-friendly, keeps improvements to core shared).
  - Optional paid: team features (shared indexes, admin policy, SSO, managed updates).
- Funding channels:
  - GitHub Sponsors tiers; NLnet/NGI, Prototype Fund, Code for Science & Society microgrants.
  - Plugin bounties for key importers (Notion/Confluence/OneNote).
- Lightweight Pro plan:
  - $5–10/month solo: priority updates, advanced export themes, power-user features.
  - Team: per-seat, adds collaboration server later (not in MVP).

Suggested 6‑month phased roadmap (expanded)
- Month 0–1 (Foundations)
  - Decide lineage (Engelbart default). Define MVP workflows and acceptance tests.
  - Repos: hyperscope-core, hs-cli, hs-tui, hs-gui, plugins/examples, website/docs.
  - Implement core: Markdown/HTML import, stable IDs, basic re-anchoring, SQLite index.
  - TUI viewer with outline + text and “copy deep link.”
  - CI: build matrix, tests, fuzz harness scaffold, cargo audit.
  - Deliverable: pre-alpha CLI/TUI; resolves and opens deep links locally.

- Month 2–3 (Productize)
  - Tauri GUI with split views; hs:// protocol handler; copy/open links system-wide.
  - Static exporter (HTML + anchors + highlighter).
  - Packagers: DMG notarized, MSI with winget, AppImage + Flatpak; Homebrew/Scoop.
  - Reproducible builds, code signing, SBOMs; crash reporting opt-in.
  - Docs site, sample corpus, 60s onboarding.
  - Early adopter pre-release; collect feedback on anchoring robustness.
  - Deliverable: beta installers; landing page draft; demo data.

- Month 4–5 (Ecosystem + quality)
  - Plugin API v0 via JSON-RPC; example importers (OPML), formatter plugin.
  - Accessibility pass; keyboard map solidified; performance pass on index and re-anchoring.
  - Integrations: VS Code extension and Obsidian plugin.
  - Browser extension for hs: protocol; telemetry schema published.
  - Deliverable: RC build; 3 GIFs and demo video recorded.

- Month 6 (Relaunch)
  - 1.0 release with installers; landing page live.
  - Launch campaign; office hours kickoff; roadmap published.
  - Establish monthly releases; triage routine; solicit plugin proposals/bounties.

KPIs and guardrails
- Functionality:
  - ≥ 95% of deep links survive typical edits in test corpus (move, split, merge, typo).
  - Index time: ≤ 10 s for 1,000 Markdown files (~10 MB total).
- UX:
  - Cold start ≤ 500 ms; deep link open ≤ 300 ms.
  - Onboarding completion rate ≥ 60% for new installs (opt-in metrics).
- Adoption:
  - 1k downloads in 30 days post-launch; 3+ community plugins in 60 days.
- Quality:
  - Crash-free sessions ≥ 99%; zero critical security advisories open > 7 days.

Risk mitigations
- Plugin ABI churn: fix by JSON-RPC schemas and feature flags; avoid in-process ABI until 2.0.
- Code signing friction: start application now for Apple/Windows certs; use a CI secret rotation plan.
- Anchoring edge cases: ship a “Report bad anchor” tool with anonymized diff capture (opt-in) and build a fuzz corpus.

Concrete link/addressing proposal (initial)
- Scheme: hs://workspace/doc-id#b=<BLOCK_GUID>&r=<START..END>&v=<VIEW>
  - BLOCK_GUID is a stable 128-bit hex derived from normalized text and structural context.
  - r is character offsets within the block; optional.
  - Fallback for web export: https://your-site/doc#b=<BLOCK_GUID>&r=... with JS to highlight and scroll.
- ID generation:
  - Normalize whitespace; compute rolling hash for boundaries; GUID = hash(block_text + parent_outline_path).
  - Store a sidecar .hsids.json mapping for plaintext formats to avoid modifying files.
- Re-anchoring:
  - Attempt GUID match; if missing, fuzzy match with context window (prev/next block hashes, top-k text shingles).

Team and effort (minimal viable team)
- 1 senior Rust engineer (core/index/anchoring).
- 1 app engineer (Tauri + integrations).
- 0.5 dev rel/PM (docs, landing page, release ops).
- Contractors/volunteers for plugins and packaging help.

Open question to tailor precisely
- Which Hyperscope lineage are you targeting?
  - Engelbart-style granular hypertext: we proceed as above; prioritize import/migration and deep link stability.
  - SSB/Hypercore P2P browser: we would swap storage/index for append-only logs, prioritize offline replication, add identity/feeds, and choose different flagship workflows (e.g., offline share and verify).
