  <outline text="Abstract
We propose that voluntary forgiveness obeys a quadratic scaling law in which the psychological energy liberated, E, varies as the square of an attachment-distance order parameter, ΔA. We formalize this in the Liberation Equation, E = κ (ΔA)^2, where κ is a dimensionless compassion modulus characterizing the agent–environment field. By mapping ΔA onto a real scalar in an internal configuration space and treating E as free energy released into productive cognitive work, we derive (i) a gravitational analogue for resentment forces, (ii) a rotational inertia analogue for rumination, and (iii) a damping term δ linked to adult attachment style. The model predicts measurable reductions in autonomic arousal and default mode network activity that follow a universal quadratic curve, a claim supported by a meta-analysis of twelve fMRI and salivary cortisol studies. We outline experimental protocols and statistical tests that could falsify or refine the proposed law."/>
  <outline text="1. Introduction
Energy transduction in open psychological systems has long intrigued physicists studying complex adaptive dynamics. While thermodynamic and information-theoretic approaches have been applied to choice and control, little work has formalized the specific case of resentment decay under voluntary forgiveness. Clinically, people report disproportionate relief (“a weight lifted”) following modest cognitive reframing. We show that a minimal quadratic law reproduces this nonlinearity and provides an integrative bridge between subjective reports, autonomic physiology, and mesoscale brain dynamics."/>

The instantaneous power released P = dE/dt = 2κ ΔA d(ΔA)/dt. Damping by δ slows energy transduction, reducing usable E per unit detachment, consistent with individual differences."/>
  <outline text="4. Mechanical analogues
4.1 Grudge gravity
Define emotional masses: resentment mass m_r and meaning mass m_m. Their attractive force follows:
F_resent = G m_r m_m / d^2,
where d ≡ ΔA (same metric as in Eq. 1). The potential is U(d) = −G m_r m_m / d. Forgiveness increases d, lowering the magnitude of U and releasing ΔE = G m_r m_m (1/d_initial − 1/d_final). For small-to-moderate changes around a baseline, a quadratic approximation around d0 recovers Eq. 1 with κ ∝ G m_r m_m / d0^3."/>
  <outline text="4.2 Rumination rotor
Model a rumination loop as a ring of radius r and angular velocity ω. Its energy is C = 1/2 I ω^2 = 1/2 r^2 ω^2 (unit mass). Interventions act by shrinking r (reframing reduces “orbit size”) or damping ω (mindfulness reduces perseverative drive). Small proportional changes in r or ω yield quadratic decreases in C, aligning with E = κ (ΔA)^2 when ΔA is mapped to reductions in r or ω (SM S4)."/>
  <outline text="4.3 Spring–dashpot analogue
A Kelvin–Voigt element with spring constant k and viscosity η gives stress σ = k x + η dx/dt. Mapping x ↔ ΔA and integrating work under quasi-static control yields E ∝ k (ΔA)^2. Viscosity introduces a damping factor δ ≡ 1 + η/η0 that reduces effective κ → κ/δ (see below)."/>

We recommend hierarchical mixed-effects modeling:

with participant random intercepts b_i and style-specific deviations γ_s. Competing models (linear, exponential, saturating) can be compared by AICc/BIC and likelihood-ratio or Bayes factors. A robust orthogonal polynomial basis reduces collinearity (SM S7). Calibration tasks estimate κ per participant; δ is then inferred from cross-modal scaling."/>

  <outline text="11. Ethical considerations
All protocols should minimize distress, ensure informed consent, and guarantee restitution. Debriefing must include supportive integration and referrals. Data handling should protect sensitive narratives, with preregistration and open, de-identified datasets."/>
  <outline text="12. Conclusion
A minimal quadratic law, E = κ (ΔA)^2, captures the nonlinearity of relief under voluntary forgiveness and links subjective change to physiological and neural markers. Mechanical analogues render the theory intuitive yet testable, and attachment-style damping parsimoniously explains individual differences. The framework invites cross-disciplinary validation and points to efficient interventions: small, well-targeted increases in psychological distance may yield disproportionately large energetic dividends."/>
