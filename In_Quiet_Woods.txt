In quiet woods where whispers roam,  
Two friends sit down, away from home,  
With hearts laid bare, their truths unwind,  
In shared exchange, their souls entwined.  

They speak of dreams, both near and far,  
Illuminating like a guiding star;  
Through every wish and silent plea,  
A bond is forged, more than just "we."  

For when the heart does dare to show  
The hidden depths of joy and woe,  
Empathy blooms in the fertile ground,  
Where understanding’s roots are found.  

No longer strangers, but partners true,  
In life's vast tapestry, they construe  
The threads of struggle, joy, and strife,  
Weaving a fabric of shared life.  

Each challenge faced, each dream pursued,  
Binds their spirits, invigorates their mood;  
In this sacred trust, they learn to grow,  
As side by side, they bravely go.  

So let the world around them spin,  
With open hearts, they let love in;  
For friendships deep, in honesty dressed,  
Become the lanterns that light the quest.  

Thus, in the woods, where silence sings,  
Through sharing needs and hopeful things,  
They find in each what they seek to find—  
A lasting bond, both strong and kind.
