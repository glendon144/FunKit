In tranquil groves where soft winds sigh,  
Two souls recline ’neath the azure sky,  
With spirits bare, their truths laid low,  
In whispered trust, their hearts do flow.  

They speak of visions, both vast and bright,  
Like celestial orbs that pierce the night;  
In every yearning, each muted cry,  
A sacred bond doth rise and fly.  

For when the heart, with courage bold,  
Reveals the tales of joy untold,  
Compassion springs in the tender earth,  
Where roots of understanding find their birth.  

No longer strangers, but kindred bright,  
In the grand design of day and night,  
They weave the threads of grief and cheer,  
Creating a fabric both rich and dear.  

Each trial met, each dream embraced,  
Binds their spirits in love interlaced;  
In this hallowed trust, they learn to soar,  
As hand in hand, they seek for more.  

So let the world in its chaos swirl,  
With hearts aglow, they let love unfurl;  
For friendships deep, in truth arrayed,  
Become the lanterns that light the way.  

Thus, in the woods where silence breathes,  
Through sharing hopes and all that weaves,  
They find in each what their souls entwine—  
A bond eternal, both strong and divine.
