We are given a user report about an issue when importing a file after they installed and modified the plugin. The error is on line 193, possibly a missing comma.
Without the actual code, we can only speculate. However, common issues at that line might be:

A missing comma in a tuple, list, or dictionary.
Syntax error due to incorrect indentation or a typo.
Since the user modified the import, it's possible that the error was introduced by the modification.

Steps to help the user:

Ask for the exact error message and the code around line 193.
If the user can't provide the code, we can try to recall what the original code might have been and if there was a known issue.
However, note: the user says they modified the import in opml_extras_plugin.py. The error might be related to that.

But the error is on line 193. If the import change was at the top, it might not be directly related unless the import change caused a cascade.

Alternatively, let me think about the original code of opml_extras_plugin.py (if we assume it's from a known source).

Since I don't have the original code, I'll provide a generic approach:

If the user can show the code around line 193, we can check for the common issues.
However, the user's message says: "The file would not import because of a problem on line 193, possibly a missing comma?"

Let me try to think: what might be at line 193? It could be:

Example of a tuple missing a comma:

  my_tuple = (1, 2 3)   # missing comma between 2 and 3
Or a dictionary:

  my_dict = {
      "a": 1,
      "b": 2   # missing comma on this line? but then the next line would be a problem too if we have another key
      "c": 3
  }
Or a function call with multiple arguments:

  func(arg1, arg2 arg3)   # missing comma between arg2 and arg3
Without the code, it's hard.

But note: the user says they modified the import. So let me ask:

What was the modification? Did they change the import statements at the top?
If they changed:

  from . import something
to

  from . import something, another_thing
and then there was a missing comma? That doesn't seem to be at line 193.

Alternatively, the error might be in a different part of the code that was not changed, but the import change caused the code to be run differently? Unlikely.

Since the error is during import, it means the error is at the top-level of the module? Or during the execution of the module.

But note: Python only runs the top-level statements when importing. So if line 193 is inside a function, it wouldn't be executed until the function is called. Therefore, the error must be in the top-level code (like a class definition, function definition, or global variable) that has a syntax error.

How can we help?

Option 1: Ask the user to provide the exact code of the file (or at least lines 180-200) to see the context.

Option 2: If the user doesn't provide the code, we can only suggest:

  "Please check line 193 and the surrounding lines for a syntax error. Common issues include missing commas in tuples, lists, or dictionaries, or a missing parenthesis/bracket. Also, check if you have accidentally removed a comma when making your changes."
But note: the user says they modified the import. So we might also ask:

  "Could you please share the exact changes you made to the import? Also, please share the code around line 193 of the file `opml_extras_plugin.py` so that I can help you better."
However, the instructions say: "You are an expert in Leo Editor and its plugins".

Let me assume that the opml_extras_plugin.py is a known plugin. But without knowing the exact version, it's hard.

Alternatively, if I recall, the original opml_extras_plugin.py from the Leo project might not have any known issue at line 193. But I don't have the exact code.

Given the constraints, I think the best approach is to ask for the code snippet.

But the user might not be able to share it? Then we can try:

"I apologize for the inconvenience. Without seeing the code, it's difficult to pinpoint the issue. However, I can suggest:

Check if you have a comma missing in a tuple, list, or dictionary definition around line 193.
Check if you have an extra parenthesis or bracket.
Check if you have a string that is not properly closed.
If you can provide the code around line 193, I can help more specifically."

But note: the user might have already tried that.

Alternatively, if the user is comfortable, they can revert the import change and see if the error goes away. Then we would know that the error was introduced by their change.

However, the user might have made the import change because the original wasn't working? We don't know.

Let me design a response accordingly.

It sounds like you've encountered a syntax issue while modifying `opml_extras_plugin.py`. While I can't see your code, a missing comma is a common cause for such errorsâ€”especially on the line you mentioned (line 193). Here's how to troubleshoot:
Common Causes at Line 193:
Missing Comma in a Collection:
If line 193 is part of a tuple, list, dictionary, or function arguments, a missing comma can break the syntax.
Example:

Python
# Incorrect (missing comma):
items = ['a', 'b' 'c', 'd']

# Correct:
items = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
Dictionary Entries:
Verify commas between key-value pairs:

Python
# Incorrect:
config = {'key1': value1 'key2': value2}

# Correct:
config = {'key1': value1, 'key2': value2}
Function Parameters:
Check commas in multi-line function calls:

Python
# Incorrect:
some_function(param1
              param2)

# Correct:
some_function(param1,
              param2)
Tuple Definitions:
Single-element tuples need a trailing comma:

Python
# Incorrect:
singleton = (42)

# Correct:
singleton = (42,)
Steps to Fix:
Inspect Line 193:
Look for collections (lists, tuples, dicts) or function calls spanning multiple lines. Ensure all elements are comma-separated.

Check Adjacent Lines:
Syntax errors often originate from earlier lines (e.g., an unclosed bracket). Review lines 190-195 carefully.

Test Isolation:
Temporarily comment out the block around line 193. If the import succeeds, the issue is in that section.

Share the Code:
If you can share a snippet of lines 180-200 (or just 193 with surrounding context), I can give precise guidance.

Example Fix:
If your original code at line 193 was:

Python
keywords = ['opml', 'export' 'import']  # Missing comma after 'export'
Fix it by adding the comma:

Python
keywords = ['opml', 'export', 'import']  # Fixed
Let me know if you can share the problematic lines or need further help!
