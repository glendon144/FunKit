Specifically: - Change `memory.db` to be stored in `./storage/memory.db` - Change `documents.db` to be stored in `./storage/documents.db` (but note the user says it already exists)\nHowever, note that the script currently uses storage/documents.db (relative path) and memory.db (which is at the root). We are to change memory.db to ./storage/memory.db.\n\nLet's look for the current references to the database files.\n\nSteps:\n\nIn the main() function, we have: storage = LocalStorage('./storage/documents.db') memory = LocalMemoryStorage('memory.db')\n\nWe want to change the memory storage to use ./storage/memory.db.\n\nAlso, note that the main() function sets up the web application and the paths.\n\nAdditionally, we should check if there are any other hardcoded references to memory.db.\n\nWe are only changing the path for the memory storage.\n\nLet's update the line in main() where LocalMemoryStorage is initialized.\n\nAlso, note that the LocalMemoryStorage class is defined in memory_storage.py and it currently takes a filename and uses it as the path.\n\nWe are going to change the argument passed to LocalMemoryStorage from 'memory.db' to './storage/memory.db'.\n\nHowever, note that the LocalMemoryStorage class in memory_storage.py uses: self.conn = sqlite3.connect(db_file)\n\nSo we can just change the path we pass.\n\nBut wait, the user might run the script from the root of the project. We should use an absolute path or relative path that is consistent.\n\nAlternatively, we can note that the script is run from the root. Therefore, we can use 'storage/memory.db' (without the dot) since the current working directory is the root.\n\nHowever, the existing documents.db is set as './storage/documents.db' which is equivalent to 'storage/documents.db' if the working directory is the root.\n\nLet's change the memory storage to 'storage/memory.db'.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the same pattern: './storage/memory.db' -> but note that ./storage is relative to the current working directory.\n\nSince the script is run from the root, both ./storage/memory.db and storage/memory.db are the same.\n\nWe'll change the line in main.py:\n\n    memory = LocalMemoryStorage('memory.db')   -> becomes:\n    memory = LocalMemoryStorage('./storage/memory.db')\nBut note: the user wants to confine all databases to the ./storage directory.\n\nAlso, we should check if the LocalMemoryStorage class creates the database file if it doesn't exist? The sqlite3 connect will create the file if it doesn't exist.\n\nHowever, we must ensure the directory exists. The storage directory already exists because we are using it for documents.db.\n\nBut what if the storage directory does not exist? The existing code for documents.db does not create the directory. We are relying on the directory already existing.\n\nWe may need to create the storage directory if it doesn't exist? However, the user says that ./storage/documents.db already exists. So we assume the directory exists.\n\nAlternatively, we can modify the code to create the directory if it doesn't exist? But that might be out of scope.\n\nSince the problem only requires changing the path, we'll change the path for the memory storage.\n\nLet's update the main.py file accordingly.\n\nHowever, note that there might be multiple occurrences of the memory storage being initialized? We are only initializing it in one place.\n\nLet me check the code:\n\nIn main.py:\n\n    from memory_storage import LocalMemoryStorage\n    ...\n    memory = LocalMemoryStorage('memory.db')\nChange that to:\n\n    memory = LocalMemoryStorage('./storage/memory.db')\nBut wait, we also have a test in test_handlers.py? We are not modifying tests unless they break.\n\nWe should check if the tests are using the memory storage? They might be creating a temporary database? Let's see:\n\nIn test_handlers.py:\n\n    from memory_storage import LocalMemoryStorage\n\n    @pytest.fixture\n    def client():\n        ...\n        memory = LocalMemoryStorage(':memory:')\n\n    They are using in-memory database for tests (`:memory:`) so we don't need to change that.\nTherefore, the only change is in main.py for the memory storage path.\n\nLet's write the change.\n\nTo confine all databases to the `./storage` directory, including the memory database, modify the script as follows:\nUpdate the Memory Storage Path\nChange the initialization of LocalMemoryStorage in main.py to use ./storage/memory.db:\n\nPython\n# main.py\ndef main():\n    # ... existing code ...\n    # Initialize storage and memory\n    storage = LocalStorage('./storage/documents.db')\n    memory = LocalMemoryStorage('./storage/memory.db')  # Modified path\n    # ... rest of the code ...\nVerify Directory Existence (Optional)\nEnsure the storage directory exists before initializing databases. Add this check at the beginning of main():\n\nPython\nimport os\n# ... existing imports ...\n\ndef main():\n    # Create storage directory if it doesn't exist\n    os.makedirs('./storage', exist_ok=True)\n    \n    # Initialize databases\n    storage = LocalStorage('./storage/documents.db')\n    memory = LocalMemoryStorage('./storage/memory.db')\n    # ... rest of the code ...\nExplanation:\n\nThe modification changes the path for memory.db from the root directory to ./storage/memory.db, centralizing all database files (documents.db and memory.db) within the ./storage directory.\nThe optional os.makedirs check ensures the storage directory exists, preventing errors if it\u2019s missing. This is safe and won\u2019t overwrite existing directories.\nNote: Test the script after making these changes to confirm databases are created/modified in ./storage.\n"
