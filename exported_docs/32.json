Just the structure.\n\nWhy this is exciting\n\n\u26a1 Fast signal extraction: Skip the noise and scan a page as an outline.\n\n\ud83e\udded Instant navigation: Expand/collapse headings with carets right in FunKit.\n\n\ud83e\uddf0 Portable: OPML plays nicely with other outline tools.\n\nHow to use it\n\nOption A \u2014 Toolbar\n\nClick URL \u2192 OPML.\n\nPaste one or more URLs (newline-separated).\n\nPress OK. The first outline opens automatically; others appear in the index.\n\nOption B \u2014 Menu\n\nFile \u2192 Import URL \u2192 OPML (same dialog as above)\n\nBatch import: paste multiple URLs at once \u2014 each becomes its own OPML document.\n\nModes & control\n\nTools \u2192 Network/URL \u2192 URL Import Mode\n\nQuick (default): ~12s total / ~600 KB per URL\n\nFull: ~25s total / ~2.5 MB per URL\n\n\ud83d\uded1 Cancelable: A small \u201cFetching URLs\u2026\u201d dialog lets you Cancel mid-import.\n\n\ud83e\uddf5 Responsive: Fetch runs in the background; the UI stays snappy.\n\n\ud83d\udcbe Safe writes: All database updates happen on the main thread (no SQLite thread errors).\n\nWhat gets saved\n\n\u2705 New OPML documents titled like: Example Page Title (OPML)\n\n\ud83d\udd12 Original HTML is not stored (we harvest structure, not the entire page)\n\nRendering & navigation\n\n\ud83e\ude84 OPML opens in the main pane with caret expand/collapse.\n\n\u2b05\ufe0f Back returns to your previous document.\n\n\ud83d\udd0d Use the Tree view anytime for a dedicated outline window.\n\nSmart fallbacks\n\nSome sites are heavy or defensive (big publisher CDNs, paywalls, etc.). We handle that:\n\n\ud83e\udde0 HTML \u2192 OPML (primary path)\n\n\u2728 Text fallback when HTML is tricky \u2014 still produces a useful outline\n\n\ud83e\uddea Validation: OPML is parsed in-memory before saving; leading noise is trimmed\n\n\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Repair tools:\n\nTools \u2192 Repair current doc \u2192 OPML (overwrite)\n\nBatch: Repair selected OPML docs (toolbar)\n\nTips for great outlines\n\nPrefer article / reader URLs when possible (less nav/UI chrome).\n\nMulti-URL imports are supported \u2014 each URL on its own line.\n\nFor very stubborn sites, try Quick mode first; if needed, switch to Full.\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nSpinner lasts too long\n\u2022 Use Quick mode, then try Cancel if the site slow-walks content.\n\u2022 Try Full mode for larger articles.\n\n\u201cUnsupported Content-Type\u201d\n\u2022 The URL isn\u2019t HTML/XML (e.g., PDF, image). Convert text separately or use other import options.\n\nOutline looks too minimal\n\u2022 That\u2019s the text fallback. Try Full mode, or use the Repair tool on the document.\n\nOptional dependencies (improves fetching)\nAlways show details\npip3 install requests chardet\n\n\nrequests \u2192 better TLS/redirects & streaming\n\nchardet \u2192 smarter encoding detection\n\nRelated features\n\n\ud83d\uddc2\ufe0f Batch: Create OPML copies (left-pane multi-select \u2192 toolbar button) \u2014 non-destructive\n\n\u2699\ufe0f OPML Preferences (Tools \u2192 OPML Preferences):\n\u2022 After Convert: Open / Link / Open+Link\n\u2022 Batch: optional header link in originals\n\nWhy OPML (again)?\n\nOPML is a timeless, lightweight way to think in outlines \u2014 a perfect bridge between Doug Engelbart\u2019s vision and today\u2019s web. By harvesting structure from pages, FunKit helps you tame the noisy web into something you can scan, reorganize, and reason about.\n\nQuick start\n\nInstall & launch FunKit\n\nClick URL \u2192 OPML on the toolbar\n\nPaste a URL (or many), hit OK\n\nExpand the carets and get the gist in seconds \u2728\nEOF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
