  "body": "Based on your original code, here are all the methods you still need to add to the reorganized file:Here's the complete list of methods you need to add to your reorganized class:\n\n**Core Methods (23 methods total):**\n\n1. **TreeView Integration (2 methods):**\n   - `on_tree_button()`\n   - `_apply_opml_expand_depth()`\n\n2. **AI/Tri-Model (1 method):**\n   - `ask_tri_action()`\n\n3. **OPML Handling (6 methods):**\n   - `_ensure_opml_widgets()`\n   - `_show_opml()`\n   - `_hide_opml()`\n   - `_render_opml_from_string()`\n   - `_opml_expand_to_depth_in_pane()`\n   - `_opml_update_numbering()`\n\n4. **Image Operations (3 methods):**\n   - `_looks_like_image()`\n   - `_show_image_bytes()`\n   - `_hide_image()`\n\n5. **Import/Export (6 methods):**\n   - `_import_doc()`\n   - `_export_doc()`\n   - `_import_directory()`\n   - `export_and_launch_server()`\n   - `_save_binary_as_text()`\n   - `_open_opml_from_main()`\n\n6. **Utility (1 method):**\n   - `destroy()` (override for cleanup)\n\n**Helper Functions (outside the class):**\n- `sanitize_doc()`\n- `_render_document_v2()` (if it exists in your original)\n\n**To complete your file:**\n\n1. Copy each of these methods from your original file\n2. Add them to the bottom of the reorganized class structure I provided\n3. Make sure to maintain the proper indentation\n4. Keep any helper functions outside the class at the very end\n\nThe reorganized structure + these missing methods should give you a fully functional GUI without the AttributeError issues!\n"
