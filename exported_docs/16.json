  "body": "In quiet woods where whispers roam,  \nTwo friends sit down, away from home,  \nWith hearts laid bare, their truths unwind,  \nIn shared exchange, their souls entwined.  \n\nThey speak of dreams, both near and far,  \nIlluminating like a guiding star;  \nThrough every wish and silent plea,  \nA bond is forged, more than just \"we.\"  \n\nFor when the heart does dare to show  \nThe hidden depths of joy and woe,  \nEmpathy blooms in the fertile ground,  \nWhere understanding\u2019s roots are found.  \n\nNo longer strangers, but partners true,  \nIn life's vast tapestry, they construe  \nThe threads of struggle, joy, and strife,  \nWeaving a fabric of shared life.  \n\nEach challenge faced, each dream pursued,  \nBinds their spirits, invigorates their mood;  \nIn this sacred trust, they learn to grow,  \nAs side by side, they bravely go.  \n\nSo let the world around them spin,  \nWith open hearts, they let love in;  \nFor friendships deep, in honesty dressed,  \nBecome the lanterns that light the quest.  \n\nThus, in the woods, where silence sings,  \nThrough sharing needs and hopeful things,  \nThey find in each what they seek to find\u2014  \nA lasting bond, both strong and kind."
