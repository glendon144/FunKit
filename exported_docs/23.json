  "body": "To add a mouse to a Python NLS (Natural Language Understanding) project, you can use a library like PyAutoGUI which allows you to control the mouse cursor and click events programmatically.\n\nHere's a simple example of how you can use PyAutoGUI to move the mouse cursor to a specific position and click:\n\n1. First, install the PyAutoGUI library by running the following command:\n```\npip install pyautogui\n```\n\n2. Import the PyAutoGUI library in your Python script:\n```python\nimport pyautogui\n```\n\n3. Use the `moveTo` function to move the mouse cursor to a specific position on the screen (x, y coordinates):\n```python\npyautogui.moveTo(x=100, y=100)\n```\n\n4. Use the `click` function to simulate a mouse click at the current cursor position:\n```python\npyautogui.click()\n```\n\nYou can also perform other mouse actions such as dragging, scrolling, etc. using PyAutoGUI. Make sure to check the PyAutoGUI documentation for more information on its capabilities.\n\nKeep in mind that using automated mouse movements and clicks can have security implications and may not be allowed in some environments, so use it responsibly."
