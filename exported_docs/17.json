  "body": "In tranquil groves where soft winds sigh,  \nTwo souls recline \u2019neath the azure sky,  \nWith spirits bare, their truths laid low,  \nIn whispered trust, their hearts do flow.  \n\nThey speak of visions, both vast and bright,  \nLike celestial orbs that pierce the night;  \nIn every yearning, each muted cry,  \nA sacred bond doth rise and fly.  \n\nFor when the heart, with courage bold,  \nReveals the tales of joy untold,  \nCompassion springs in the tender earth,  \nWhere roots of understanding find their birth.  \n\nNo longer strangers, but kindred bright,  \nIn the grand design of day and night,  \nThey weave the threads of grief and cheer,  \nCreating a fabric both rich and dear.  \n\nEach trial met, each dream embraced,  \nBinds their spirits in love interlaced;  \nIn this hallowed trust, they learn to soar,  \nAs hand in hand, they seek for more.  \n\nSo let the world in its chaos swirl,  \nWith hearts aglow, they let love unfurl;  \nFor friendships deep, in truth arrayed,  \nBecome the lanterns that light the way.  \n\nThus, in the woods where silence breathes,  \nThrough sharing hopes and all that weaves,  \nThey find in each what their souls entwine\u2014  \nA bond eternal, both strong and divine."
