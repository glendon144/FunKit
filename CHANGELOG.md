## ✨ OPML Rendering & TreeView lineage milestone — 2025-08-07

- Automatic OPML detection and rendering in the document pane.
- Integrated OPML parsing directly into _render_document (BOM-safe).
- Fixed geometry manager conflict (grid vs pack) in OPML view.
- Restored toolbar handlers (e.g., _on_delete_clicked, _handle_image).
- TreeView lineage displays correctly from green links.
- OPML tree depth preference persists until changed by user.

Tagging this as the first stable OPML-capable build of PiKit.
