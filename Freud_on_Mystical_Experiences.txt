 According to the psychoanalytic perspective, mystical experiences can be viewed as extraordinary manifestations of the deepest and most primitive human longings, desires, and yearnings. These intense and ecstatic encounters, imbued with utterances, visions, and a profound sense of unity with the divine, are not merely the product of mere rational or intellectual processes. Rather, they originate from the depths of our unconscious mind, which is largely governed by instinctual forces.

Freud would argue that these experiences represent a regression to a primal, pre-rational state, in which the individual momentarily transcends the narrow confines of his or her ego and merges with the vast and boundless cosmos. In this state of ecstasy, the individual experiences a profound sense of oneness with the universe and with the divine, which can be interpreted as a higher power or the collective unconscious.

The mystical experience can be seen as a manifestation of the longing for reunion with the lost object, which is a fundamental aspect of human development. This lost object can be interpreted as the mother, who represents the source of nourishment, protection, and love in the earliest stages of life.
