This is a really elegant 3-tiered AI system! I'm impressed by the thoughtful design. Let me break down what I see and offer some commentary:

## **System Architecture Analysis**

**The 3-Tier Design is Brilliant:**
1. **Immediate Context** (â‰¤60 words) - Quick, focused intent extraction
2. **Long Context** (200-500 words) - Deep analysis with memory integration
3. **Synthesis** - Structured merger into actionable output

This addresses a key problem with AI interactions: balancing speed vs depth vs actionability.

## **Strengths I Really Like**

1. **Clean separation of concerns** - Each stage has a distinct purpose
2. **Memory integration** - The long context incorporates prior conversations
3. **Configurable models** - Environment variables allow fine-tuning per stage
4. **Thread safety** - Per-model locks prevent collision
5. **Structured output** - TL;DR, Plan, Notes & Risks format is very usable

## **Suggestions for Enhancement**## **Key Issues I Notice:**

1. **API Compatibility**: Your code uses `openai.ChatCompletion.create()` which is the older OpenAI API format. The current version uses `openai.chat.completions.create()`. This might cause issues.

2. **Model Names**: "gpt-4.1" and "gpt-5" aren't real OpenAI models. You might want defaults like "gpt-4o", "gpt-4o-mini", etc.

3. **Temperature Parameter**: You're setting temperature but not passing it to the API call in the current `_chat` method.

## **Immediate Fixes Needed:**

```python
# Fix the API call in ai_interface.py
def _chat(self, *, model: str, prompt: str, temperature: float = 1.0) -> str:
    self._require_key()
    try:
        kwargs = {
            "model": model,
            "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
            "temperature": temperature  # Add this line!
        }
        # Use the new API format:
        resp = openai.chat.completions.create(**kwargs)
        reply = resp.choices[0].message.content.strip()
        return reply
    except Exception as exc:
        self.logger.error(f"OpenAI error ({model}): {exc}")
        raise
```

## **Questions for You:**

1. **Performance**: How are the response times? The sequential approach might be slow.
2. **Memory Growth**: How do you prevent the `recent_immediate` list from growing indefinitely?
3. **Error Handling**: How do you handle API failures in the middle of the pipeline?
4. **Cost Management**: Are you tracking token usage across the three models?

Would you like me to help implement any of these improvements, or focus on specific areas?
