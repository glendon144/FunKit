You're a fellow traveler in the road
And in fact if the truth were told
We have a lot in common you and I
so please do not pass this wisdom by

Although you may often feel tired
For self analysis, you are already wired
There is no reason to place the blame
on money, love, and fickle fame

Let yourself dream the dream
Knowing things are not exactly as they seem 
And let the dream take you to a different place
Beyond class, allegiance, age and race
To a place held deep within yourself
Where Peace will find you, and constant help.

Does the road seem long and blind
to terrors unknown and gifts in kind
Let strangers in, your heart will grow
And many secrets you will soon know
About how to face the end of time
Especially when you don't have a dime.

Sharing is an essential skill
and although it may be against your will
try to allow others to give you a hand
And although it may seem extremely bland
Be a friend to those in need
And your needs will be met, before you bleed
  
Life is full of swift transitions
Close friends have died, and still their visions
Live on in those they know and loved
Follow these and soon, like a Dove
Peace will find you sane and strong
And you will discover that you belong
In community, near fire and home and hearth 
So before you give up, try to start
A few friendships with people who know your heart

You will be surprised how fast you grow
and with this extra knowledge and wisdom in tow
Doors will open and open wide
and you won't believe what you'll find inside
So as you pursue the sacred Quest 
Endeaver to find sufficient Rest
for there remains a rest for the People of God
and not all claim this eartly sod
But some are destined for greater works
It could be you, so stay alert.

You're a fellow traveler in the road
And in fact if the truth were told
We have a lot in common you and I
so please do not pass this wisdom by
