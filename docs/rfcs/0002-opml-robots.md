# RFC 0002 â€” OPML-Robots: Voluntary Omission for OPML Hypermaps
**Status:** Draft  
**Editors:** Glen Gross, Contributors

## Abstract
This document defines a voluntary mechanism for publishers and operators to request omission or redaction of links in **public** OPML hypermaps (RFC 0001). It complements the Robots Exclusion Protocol (RFC 9309) for HTTP(S) and introduces a protocol-agnostic deny-list format suitable for OPML-based tooling.
