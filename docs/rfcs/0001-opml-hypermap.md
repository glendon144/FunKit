# RFC 0001 — OPML Hypermap: A Protocol- and Markup-Agnostic Outline Format
**Status:** Draft  
**Editors:** Glen Gross, Contributors  
**Inspired by:** Douglas C. Engelbart’s augmentation and knowledge workshop principles

## Abstract
This document proposes a minimal, backward-compatible extension profile for OPML (Outline Processor Markup Language) to serve as a protocol- and markup-agnostic **hypermap**. The goal is to represent the structural skeleton of resources discovered across heterogeneous protocols (e.g., `https`, `gemini`, `gopher`, `ipfs`, `file`) and markups (HTML, Gemtext, Markdown, etc.) while preserving consent norms (e.g., `robots.txt`) and provenance. The extension uses optional, underscore-prefixed attributes that legacy OPML software will ignore safely.
